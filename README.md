# sudoku-solver
Fast sudoku solver to be used in future for a simple computer vision project, curretly decently fast for 9x9 matrixes 
From rough testing seams to be on par or faster than tdoku on kaggle 1 million sudokus
## TODOs:
* Write a argument parser to switch between batch prediction from file and single prediction
* Test dacing links method
* actually output something to a file
